At the time of the start of the project, many other programs that supported the Advanced Substation Alpha format lacked (and in many cases, still lack; development on several competing programs have since been dropped for various reasons completely unrelated to Aegisub) many vital functions, or were too buggy and/or unreliable to be really useful.</description></item><item><title>Highlights</title><link>https://aeg-dev.github.io/AegSite-hugo/docs/introduction/highlights/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aeg-dev.github.io/AegSite-hugo/docs/introduction/highlights/</guid><description>Some highlights of Aegisub:

Karaoke effects? See the [[Karaoke Templater tutorials|Automation/Karaoke_Templater/Tutorial_1]].
Can I create DVD subtitles with Aegisub? Not directly, but there&amp;rsquo;s a nifty program called MaestroSBT that can convert SSA to VOBSubs. It does have quite a bunch of restrictions on what tags and other things may be used, so reading its manual first is advised. Also note that it does not accept ASS - only SSA.</description></item><item><title>Tutorials</title><link>https://aeg-dev.github.io/AegSite-hugo/docs/introduction/tutorials/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aeg-dev.github.io/AegSite-hugo/docs/introduction/tutorials/</guid><description>The following tutorials are available for Aegisub:
