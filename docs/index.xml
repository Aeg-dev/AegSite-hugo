At the time of the start of the project, many other programs that supported the Advanced Substation Alpha format lacked (and in many cases, still lack; development on several competing programs have since been dropped for various reasons completely unrelated to Aegisub) many vital functions, or were too buggy and/or unreliable to be really useful.</description></item><item><title>Highlights</title><link>https://aeg-dev.github.io/AegSite-hugo/docs/introduction/highlights/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aeg-dev.github.io/AegSite-hugo/docs/introduction/highlights/</guid><description>Some highlights of Aegisub:
Simple and intuitive yet powerful interface for editing subtitles With help from such features as spell checking/thesaurus, a translation assistant, call tips for override tags, syntax highlighting and various macros, translating, editing and quality assuring subtitles is now easier than ever.

Karaoke effects? See the [[Karaoke Templater tutorials|Automation/Karaoke_Templater/Tutorial_1]].
Can I create DVD subtitles with Aegisub? Not directly, but there&amp;rsquo;s a nifty program called MaestroSBT that can convert SSA to VOBSubs. It does have quite a bunch of restrictions on what tags and other things may be used, so reading its manual first is advised. Also note that it does not accept ASS - only SSA.</description></item><item><title>Tutorials</title><link>https://aeg-dev.github.io/AegSite-hugo/docs/introduction/tutorials/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aeg-dev.github.io/AegSite-hugo/docs/introduction/tutorials/</guid><description>The following tutorials are available for Aegisub:

These are available in the options dialog box, found in the View menu. This page is a reference of all the available options.
Aegisub stores all its configuration in a plain text file called config.json which by default is stored in the [[?user|Aegisub_path_specifiers]] directory. If you want to reset Aegisub to its default options without reinstalling the program, you can just delete config.</description></item><item><title>Properties</title><link>https://aeg-dev.github.io/AegSite-hugo/docs/miscellaneous/properties/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aeg-dev.github.io/AegSite-hugo/docs/miscellaneous/properties/</guid><description>The script properties are some headers and other options that affect the entire script in various ways. They can be accessed from the File menu -&amp;gt; Properties.
{: class=&amp;ldquo;center&amp;rdquo;}
The properties are:
Title, Original script, Translation, Editing, Timing, Synch point, Updated by and Update details - These are for informational purposes only and do not affect rendering in any way. Set them to appropriate values if you find them useful.</description></item><item><title>Attachment Manager</title><link>https://aeg-dev.github.io/AegSite-hugo/docs/miscellaneous/attachment_manager/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aeg-dev.github.io/AegSite-hugo/docs/miscellaneous/attachment_manager/</guid><description>The attachment manager allows you to attach fonts and/or pictures to your script (by encoding them as text). This is occasionally useful for sharing fonts between everyone who is working on a script without having to send the fonts as separate files. However, it is quite limited and is prone to causing problems.
Overview The entire dialogue is fairly self-explanatory. The two &amp;ldquo;Attach &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; buttons add attachments, &amp;ldquo;Extract&amp;rdquo; extracts existing attachments into separate files, and &amp;ldquo;Delete&amp;rdquo; deletes attachments from the subtitles file.</description></item></channel></rss>
